<h3 style="color:#000080">SECTION 4 - REASONS FOR MY RECOMMENDING COMBINED INSURANCE COVER</h3>
<h3 style="color:#0E69AB">Why my recommendation is appropriate for you</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%">
<b><u>Goals and Objectives</u></b><br />
Mr Sumit Monga, your objective is to ensure that you have sufficient income to pay your monthly expenses and help maintain your lifestyle. You indicated that it is important to you that you:
￼Protect your ability to earn and income (Sickness Disability Benefit), Protect your ability to earn and income (Accident Disability Benefit), Protect for unexpected expenses - Family Lodging Benefit(Accident), Protect for unexpected expenses - Transportation Benefit(Accident), Protect for unexpected expenses - Accidental Death Funeral Benefit
</p>
<p style="font-size:120%">
<b><u>Personal Circumstances</u></b><br />
Based on the information you have provided, I have taken into account the fact that you are 32 years old and are Single and have 0 dependants and are concerned that you have sufficient income in the event of an injury or illness .
</p>
<p style="font-size:120%">
<b><u>Financial Circumstances</u></b><br />
In assessing your disposable income of approximately $6,500.00 a month, it would appear that on the basis of the information supplied, the monthly premiums I am proposing of $481.62 are within your means.
</p>
<p style="font-size:120%">
<b><u>Existing Insurance</u></b><br />
I have taken into account as to whether you currently hold similar Disability insurance, either stand alone or attached to a Superannuation plan, this will determine the level of cover you will be eligible for. You have confirmed that you do not hold
</p>
<p style="font-size:120%">
<b><u>Other Relevant factors (if any)</u></b><br />

</p>

<p style="font-size:120%">
<b><u>￼￼Your Risk Profile: Insurance reduces your risk</u></b><br />
Insurance transfers to the insurer some of the potential financial loss you, or your dependants, may suffer in the unfortunate event of a claim on the Policy/s I am recommending. If you accept my recommendation, your intention is to reduce your risk if an insurable event occurs.
</p>

<p style="font-size:120%">
<b><u>Some limitations of this insurance cover you should consider</u></b><br />
Insurance policies generally contain certain limitations and exclusions which may affect you in the event of a claim. For instance, the benefits defined in the contract may not cover your entire loss. I have also explained to you the Policy Exclusions such as Pre-existing conditions and you indicated to me that you understand and accept these Exclusions.
</p>

<p style="font-size:120%">
<b><u>Appropriateness</u></b><br />

<b><u>Endorsements</u></b><br />
