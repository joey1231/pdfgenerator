I have reviewed the issues we discussed recently and analysed the details collected in the Fact Find and enclose my findings in this report.  As agreed during our previous meeting, this report will document my recommendations in relation to covering your objectives and needs.

<p style="font-size:120%">
The following report outlines your personal risks, the appropriate insurance solutions, and the amount of cover needed to meet the financial requirement in these events, it is prepared from information supplied by you and so is dependent on the completeness and accuracy of that information.

</ul>

Taxation law and the regulations governing them is complex and a highly specialised subject and I would recommend that you consult the appropriate experts who deal with these matters on a regular basis.
