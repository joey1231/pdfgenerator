<p style="font-size:120%">
Thank you for taking the time to consider the contents of this report.
</p>
<p style="font-size:120%">
As you will have read, the recommendations are based on your personal risks, the appropriate
insurances and levels of cover to fit your requirements.
It is now up to you to decide whether you will protect all, part, or none of the risks I have identified.
</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;color:#0E7EC0">
The options from here are as follows:
</p>
<ul style="font-size:120%">
  <li>Proceed with the recommendations</li>
  <li>Proceed with variations</li>
  <li>Not proceed at this stage.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size:120%">
The following page contains authorisation and acknowledgements to affect this.
</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;color:#0E7EC0">
If you decide to proceed:
</p>
<ul style="font-size:120%">
  <li>It is vital that all information provided to the insurance company is accurate and contains full disclosure. Please refer to Appendix 1 in this report for further information on your disclosure requirements.</li>
  <li>The process from here is based on factors that may change, but generally includes the following:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Completion of an Application Form</li>
      <li>Submission of the Application Form to the insurance company</li>
      <li>Underwriting process during which time the insurance company may contact you (NB: this may include the insurance company contacting your nominated doctor for further information)</li>
      <li>Policy documents being sent to you from the insurance company</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>It is important that once your insurance is put in place that we continue to review it to ensure that it continues to meet your needs as your life changes. This doesn’t always mean taking out additional cover, but it does make sure the cover you have is appropriate for your needs. It is also a good opportunity to review any new products, as insurance companies often update their products to take into account changing lifestyles and improving medical practices</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size:120%">
If you have any questions relating to this document, the authorisation forms or any part of this process, please don’t hesitate to ask.
